## FreeCodeCamp Projects

Welcome to my FreeCodeCamp Projects repository! Here, you'll find five projects completed as part of the Data_Analysis_with_Python course. Let's explore each project:

1. **Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator**: In this project, I implemented the `calculate()` function in `mean_var_std.py` using NumPy. It calculates the mean, variance, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, and sum of a 3 x 3 matrix. This project expanded my skills in working with multidimensional arrays in Python.

2. **Demographic Data Analyzer**: Using Pandas, I analyzed a dataset extracted from the 1994 Census database. This project provided valuable insights into human resources, such as the representation of different races, the average age of men, the percentage of individuals with a Bachelor's degree, and the percentage of individuals earning over 50K based on their education level and working hours.

3. **Medical Data Visualizer**: In this project, I explored medical examination data using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas. The dataset contained information on body measurements, blood tests, and lifestyle choices. By visualizing the data, I gained insights into the relationships between cardiac disease, body measurements, blood markers, and lifestyle choices.

4. **Page View Time Series Visualizer**: Using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I visualized a dataset representing the daily page views on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03. Through line charts, bar charts, and box plots, I uncovered patterns in visits, identified yearly and monthly growth, and studied the forum's popularity over time.

5. **Sea Level Predictor**: Analyzing a dataset of global average sea level change since 1880, I utilized data analysis techniques to predict sea level change up to the year 2050. This project provided valuable insights into the long-term trends and potential future scenarios related to sea level rise.

Feel free to explore each project and delve into the code to gain a deeper understanding of my data analysis skills. These projects have been a significant part of my learning journey, and I'm excited to share them with you in this repository.

Please note that the datasets used in these projects were provided by FreeCodeCamp as part of the course curriculum.
